In this project, I tried to implement several advanced machine learning practices. The aim here is to create a mental model of a Data Science problem and define a basic approach to any related problems. Some techniques I tried are Feature Engineering, Pipeline building, hyperparameter tunning through Grid Search and Random Search, Custom Transformers.
